Soo... we'll call the function Square.  Square has a number parameter.  We will return number times number.

Our variable says that number will equal square function (N times N), with the number parameter being 2.  There is an order of operations aspect.  The same term can have different values on the page... because sometimes that term is being acted upon, and other... things are receiving that finished output  

function square(number) {
    return number * number;
}

let number = square(2);
console.log(number);
